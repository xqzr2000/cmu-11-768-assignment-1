"""Build a task's testbed image using the independent Docker runtime.

The repository under test is copied in from `task.source` — normally the
`chess_app/` submodule — rather than cloned inside the build. That keeps the
build offline, works with a private repository without any credential, and
avoids a network round trip on every rebuild.

The cost is that the image reflects whatever is on disk, so `verify_source`
checks the `chess_app` source before every build to confirm it matches the
source the assignment intends people to fix. A testbed silently built from an
already-fixed working tree would make a broken agent look like it passed.
